Awesome—I'll create the deliverable notebook for you and keep the workflow aligned with the resources you shared. I’ve generated a ready-to-run PyTorch notebook that implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on the Deep Learning A–Z (Churn Modelling) dataset and includes clear comments on hyperparameter tuning and a small random search.
Your notebook:
ANN_Churn_PyTorch.ipynb
What’s inside the notebook

Data loading & preprocessing

Expects Churn_Modelling.csv in the same folder.
Drops identifier columns (RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname).
Encodes Gender (binary) and Geography (one-hot).
Train/Val/Test split (60/20/20) with standardization based on train statistics.


PyTorch ANN model

Configurable hidden units, layers, and dropout.
Trains with Adam and BCEWithLogitsLoss.
Early stopping on validation accuracy.


Hyperparameter tuning (small random search)

Randomly samples combinations of:

lr: {1e-3, 5e-4, 1e-4}
hidden_dim: {16, 32, 64}
num_layers: {1, 2}
dropout: {0.0, 0.2, 0.5}
batch_size: {32, 64, 128}
weight_decay: {0.0, 1e-5, 1e-4}


Picks the best config by validation accuracy.


Final training & evaluation

Retrains on train+val using best hyperparameters.
Evaluates on the test split (accuracy + ROC-AUC if scikit-learn is available).


Artifacts

Saves models/best_ann.pth and models/preprocessing.json (with mean/std and best hparams).




This structure is practical and learner-friendly—exactly the kind of workflow RaiseAcad learners appreciate.

How to run

Download the Kaggle dataset and place Churn_Modelling.csv in the notebook’s folder (the dataset page is linked in your instructions).
Open the notebook and run cells top-to-bottom.
Optional: increase max_trials or widen the search space to perform more exhaustive tuning.

Notes on tuning (included in the notebook)

Start with lr = 1e-3 for Adam; lower it if training plateaus or is noisy.
Increase hidden_dim or num_layers if you see underfitting; reduce or add dropout/weight decay if overfitting.
Use early stopping with patience 5–6 on validation accuracy.
Track ROC-AUC alongside accuracy for a better view of class separation.
