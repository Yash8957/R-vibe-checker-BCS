Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They form the foundation of most modern deep learning algorithms and frameworks. ANNs consist of layers of interconnected nodes, called neurons, organized into three main types: input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Each connection between neurons carries a weight, and each neuron applies an activation function to introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns.
The learning process in ANNs involves two key steps: forward propagation and backpropagation. In forward propagation, input data passes through the network, producing an output. Backpropagation then calculates the error between predicted and actual outputs and adjusts the weights using optimization algorithms like gradient descent. This iterative process minimizes the loss function and improves the model’s accuracy over time.
ANNs are widely used in applications such as image recognition, speech processing, natural language understanding, and recommendation systems. Their ability to approximate any mathematical function makes them powerful tools for solving diverse real-world problems.
To implement ANNs practically, frameworks like PyTorch are highly recommended. PyTorch provides dynamic computation graphs and an intuitive interface, making it ideal for beginners. Start by building a simple feedforward network, experimenting with activation functions such as ReLU or Sigmoid, and observing how weights update during training. This hands-on approach will help you understand the core principles behind neural networks.
