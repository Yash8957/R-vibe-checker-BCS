Models implemented (brownie points ✅):

LSTM (multi-layer, dropout)
GRU (multi-layer, dropout)

Pipeline:

Data source selection

Default: local CSV (synthetic_stock_AAPL_like.csv).
Optional: set USE_YFINANCE=True to fetch OHLCV for any ticker with yfinance (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, RELIANCE.NS). yfinance provides a Pythonic wrapper over Yahoo Finance’s public endpoints and is meant for research/educational use only; check terms of use mentioned on its project page. [in-prod.as...rosoft.com], [in-prod.as...rosoft.com]
Alternatively, you can swap in a Kaggle dataset (there are many stock-price datasets published, e.g., NASDAQ equities or specific tickers), if you prefer an offline real-world dataset. [pypi.org], [ranaroussi.github.io]


Preprocessing

Sort by date, scale features (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) with MinMaxScaler.
Create sliding windows (sequence length = 60) to predict next-day Close.
Time-based train/val/test split (e.g., 80/10/10).


Training

Adam optimizer, MSE loss, best-state restore based on validation loss.


Evaluation & Visualization

RMSE, MAE, MAPE (in original price scale).
Plot Predicted vs Actual Close on the test set for both LSTM and GRU.


Artifacts

Saves model weights (artifacts/lstm_model.pt, artifacts/gru_model.pt) and predictions for reuse.
Quick start (local run)


Create a virtual env (recommended) and install dependencies:
pip install torch pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


for live data

pip install yfinance


yfinance is the common, research-friendly choice to fetch market data programmatically and has documentation and terms outlined on its PyPI and docs pages. [in-prod.as...rosoft.com], [in-prod.as...rosoft.com]


Open the notebook (stock_seq_prediction.ipynb) and run cells:

By default it loads synthetic_stock_AAPL_like.csv.
To use real data, set in the config cell:


USE_YFINANCE = True
TICKER = 'AAPL'    # or 'RELIANCE.NS', 'TSLA', etc.
START = '2015-01-01'

Inspect outputs

Metrics (RMSE/MAE/MAPE) will print in the evaluation cell.
A chart comparing Actual vs LSTM vs GRU predictions will display.
Trained weights + predictions are saved under ./artifacts.




About the synthetic dataset

The CSV mimics AAPL-like behavior from 2015-01-01 to 2025-12-15 on business days:

Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume, and a Ticker column (AAPL_SYN).
Prices are generated using geometric Brownian motion (drift + volatility); intraday ranges (High/Low) and log-normal Volume with mild trend/seasonality are added for realism.


This lets train and evaluate the pipeline offline now, then flip to real data via yfinance later. yfinance usage is extensively documented and widely adopted for educational projects like this.
